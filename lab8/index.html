					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were tasked with creating two functions: one to be used as a callback, and an anonymous function. After creating our functions, we tested them by printing the results.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For the majority of this lab, I found the task relatively straightforwar until I got to task x. After spending a while fiddling with the syntax as usual, I was eventually able to get the script to properly print on the page, though I feel like I spent more time trying to figure this out than I had to.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Below are the outputs of the various functions as well as the printed array:</p>
