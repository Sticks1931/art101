			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding & Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> We were tasked with creating two collections of pseudocode: one for an everyday task and the other for a simple computer game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I didn't have any problems/struggles with this lab since it was just pseudocoding. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Below are the two lists of pseudocode in the form of javascript comments:</p>
					<pre><code> 
						// Watercolor Painting:

							// 1. Find an area to work
							// 2. Gather materials (paper, paint, paintbrushes, water, cup, paper towel or rag )
							// 3. Fill a cup with water halfway
							// 4. Dip your cup into the water
							// 5. Remove excess water from your paintbrush
							// 6. Swirl your paintbrush in the desired color in your paint palette
							// 7. Put the paintbrush to your paper, paint to the heart’s content 
							// 8. To switch colors, swirl the paintbrush in water
							// 9. Repeat steps 5-7 until you are happy with your art

						// Rock Paper Scissors

							// 1. Ask the user how many rounds they want to play for
							// 2. Prompt user to enter one of three inputs (R./P./S. respectively)
							// 3. Randomly generate an answer (Rock, Paper, or Scissors)
							// 4. Win/calculative functions:
							// 5. Score assignment: check who gets the point out of the pre-established rounds/variable
								// 5a. Win conditions: check what beats what
								// 5b. I.e “If player enters paper against scissors, then player gets point”
							// 6. Loop steps 2-4 until the round counter reaches the max it was set to
