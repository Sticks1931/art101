                <p> My name is Sean Y, a 3rd AGMP transfer. I enjoy drawing/illustrating, writing, reading, watching movies/shows, and playing video games. I intend to become an independent game developer after I graduate with my degree, and hopefully I'll perhaps be able to start my own independent studio with a team of trusted developers. Unfortunately, I don't have a partner to talk about.</p>
