			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays & Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we've been tasked with making an array named "myTransport," which lists the types of transport I use, and an object called "myMainRide," which represents my main method of transportation that happens to be my car. After defining both, we were then tasked with printing them, then linking the script to this here page.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some trouble with the function part of the age key, but it turns out I was just incorrectly referencing the key itself so "21" never showed up. All I forgot was to put the parantheses after at the end of the reference.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Below is an image of an identical car, a description of it via printing the myMainRide object, as well as a list of transportation methods I use via printing the myTransport array: </p>
