			<div id ="challenge">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were tasked with writing a function which takes the length of a user-inputted string and uses modulo conditionals to determine what Hogwarts house they'd belong to. After the user has been sorted by the function, their house is returned to them on the page.</p>

			<div id = "problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Embarrassingly enough, the only problem I had with the main part of this lab was forgetting to put the quotes inside the jQuery element finders, so I spent a few minutes confused on why my javascript wasn't working.</p>
			</div>

			<div id = "results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>What house do you belong to?</p>
					<div id="output">
                        Please enter your name for sorting:
                        <input  type="text" id="input" placeholder = "Enter Name Here">
