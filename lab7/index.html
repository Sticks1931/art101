					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were tasked with creating a function that takes the user's name as an input, then returns a "sorted" version of their name.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For some reason, the page prompts the user for their name twice. When I leave the second prompt empty, the script still works as intended, but I'm not really sure on what's causing the prompt to pop-up twice. I also worked on the fourth prompt for task x, which had me try to figure out how to properly insert a div with a specific class into my javascript output. It took me a few minutes, but I was eventually able to figure out to write it properly.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Below is the output of the nameSort function:</p>
